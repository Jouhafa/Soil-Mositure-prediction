# Soil-Mositure-prediction
(Predicting soil moisture using satellite imagery)
## 1- Subject : 
Soil moisture content is an important parameter in agricultural applications since accurate forecasts of soil moisture conditions can help in irrigation scheduling, water quality monitoring, 
and yield forecasting. However, it remains very challenging to get an accurate estimation of this factor. Moreover, using sensor to get in-situ data is guaranteeing the best estimation yet it's more expensive. Therefore, through this project the main work will be on solving this trade-off. 

## 2- Problematic : 
In agriculture, it's essential to know the state of your soil, more precisely the moisture of the soil before launching your irrigation schedule. Nowadays, farmers are using in-situ sensors to get the information, yet this process costs a lot of money. On the other hand, scientists are trying to use data science to build models that can predict an accurate value of this parameter, but the challenge remains on getting the right inputs, and enough data about the subject. 
 
## 3- Proposed solution :
In this project, we propose to use satellite imagery, and potentially radar data, to feed our machine learning models that will offer us by the end an automatic feature extraction for soil moisture content. 
 
## 4- Potential Obstacles :
But, as any other project, I expect some obstacles to prevent a smooth flow of this work. First of all, building the getting understanding of the phenomenon and its effect on the irrigation scheduling. Secondly, the collection of data that encounter this parameter and data processing. Finally, a good accuracy that will really allow us to lean on satellite imagery instead of sensors.
